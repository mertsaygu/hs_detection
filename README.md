# Hidradenitis Suppurativa

Hidradenitis Suppurativa(HS) is a painful, log term skin condition that causes abscesses and scarring on the skin. The exact cause of Hidradenitis Suppurativa is unknown, but it occurs near hair follicles where there are sweat glands, usually around the groin, bottom, breasts and armpits.

For reasons that are unknown, more women than men have the condition. It's thought to affect about 1% of the population.

**HS is Not**
- Contagious
- A Sexually Transmitted Disease(STD)
- MRSA or a bacterial infection
- The result of poor hygiene
# Staging
## Hurley clinical Staging 


- Hurley Stage I - is a single lesion without sinus tract formation
- Hurley Stage II - manifests as more than one lesion area , but with limited tunelling 
- Hurley Staging III - is defined as multiple lesions, with more extensive sinus tract formations and scarring. It involves an entire area of the body.

## Physician Global Assessment for Hidradenitis Suppurativa (HS-PGA)

The six-point hidradenitis suppurativa Physician Global Assessment (PGA) ranges from clear to very severe. It is used in clinical trials to measure clinical improvement in inflammatory nodules, abscesses and draining fistulae

## Aim of the project

Training a neural network that can detect Abscesses, Draining Fistullae, Inflamatuar/Noninflamatuar Nodules Etc. so the software can give initial HS-PGA staging information to the doctor.

Dataset was provided and labeled by the collaborators who are trained medical doctors. I will not share the dataset publicly in regards to ethical concerns even though the dataset does not include any personal information about the patient. 

I will update this page when I got promising results.
